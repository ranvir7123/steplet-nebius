## Setup

### Task 2: Rust tools on Windows

Command: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File spikes\tools\setup_windows.ps1`, then one more
fuzz run by hand (last section of the log).

{{LOG:setup-windows.txt}}

**Finding:** fuzzing works on Windows (MSVC), but only with the AddressSanitizer runtime folder of the Visual
Studio build tools on `PATH` for the run:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.44.35207\bin\Hostx64\x64`.
Without it the fuzz program cannot start (`0xc0000135, STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND`); without the sanitizer it does not
link (`unresolved external symbol __start___sancov_cntrs`). Phase 1 runs its fuzz target on Windows with that
folder added to `PATH` for the fuzz command only; Rust inside WSL is not needed for fuzzing.

### Task 3: the test distribution

Created by the user with `wsl --install Ubuntu-26.04 --name steplet-test`, user `tester`, then
`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm socat bubblewrap ripgrep git python3`.
Read-only checks: `wsl -d steplet-test --exec /bin/bash /mnt/c/dev/runFile/spikes/wsl/check_distro.sh`.

### Task 4: Steplet's folders, Claude Code 2.1.220, srt 0.0.77, spike data

Command: `wsl -d steplet-test --exec /bin/bash /mnt/c/dev/runFile/spikes/wsl/setup_steplet.sh`

### Task 5: self-tests of the harness

Scripted model, inside the test distribution (`python3 -I spikes/tools/selftest_fake_model.py`):

{{LOG:selftest-fake-model.txt}}

Gate and pipe, on Windows (`spikes\tools\selftest_gate.ps1`). The first version piped the MCP lines through
PowerShell, which put a byte-order mark (`EF BB BF`) in front of the first line, so the gate could not read the
opening message and every case failed with 2 replies instead of 3, although each decision was right. The test now
hands the gate a file; the gate is unchanged.
